# Problem Definition

Context is critical to understanding human communication. It is used by humans to encode knowledge
assumed to be shared, disambiguate between otherwise equivalent options, and simply convey things
more efficiently than might otherwise be possible. Thus, in order for robotic teams to be able to
coexist with humans and collaborate on complex tasks, we must have a general means of understanding
contextual information and including it in the language grounding process.

As detailed in the [related work](#related-work), the problem of context inclusion has previously
been studied with limited success. Most approaches are only capable of incorporating very limited
forms of context (i.e. basic knowledge about the environment configuration), require retraining of
the model for changes in context, and/or insufficiently capture the temporally varying nature of
context.

We think that we can succeed in this area where others have failed due to two factors: First,
we can use insights into the nature of context specifically in terms of its use for grounding to 
create a sufficiently abstract mathematical framework for context to describe general sources. 
Second, the
advent of deep learning approaches (specifically such things as sequence prediction and attention
mechanisms) may prove useful for selecting salient context.

## Goals

We want a system that can (a) [select relevant context](#selecting-context) at any given point in an 
interaction and (b) [incorporate general sources  of context](#distribution-modifying-functions) 
into the symbol grounding process to mitigate potential ambiguous/mistaken groundings.

By (a) we mean that the system should be able to take in a record of an interaction to a certain 
point in time and determine a weighting of a set of sources of context which corresponds to how much 
they matter at the current time[^recursive].

By (b) we mean that the system should be able to take an abstract representation of a source of 
context adhering to some predefined interface and use it to correctly ground symbols in cases where 
the result would be ambiguous or incorrect without knowledge of the context. Sources of context we 
would like to be able to encode (as examples) include minimally:

Environmental Context:
: Knowledge of concrete objects and actions, as well as properties of the same.

Historical Context:
: Essentially, memory of what has been important thus far in the interaction/memory of the 
interaction thus far.

Task Context:
: Semantic understanding of the current task (and subtasks, etc.), which informs what actions and 
objects are likely to be salient.

Physical Feasibility:
: Introspective understanding of the physical properties of the robot and of objects in the 
environment. This includes things like reachability, ability to manipulate in a certain way, etc.

Non-Verbal Entity Indicators:
: Gestures, etc. that can indicate a certain action or object.

[^recursive]: This task seems remarkably similar to the context construction problem.
  Maybe there's a higher level/more general problem of which they're both instances that we could use to solve 
  them both at once?

# Related Work

- @misra_tell_2016 use an energy function approach to grounding to encode limited environmental 
  context. They can't capture things like historical context, general object properties (the model 
  they learn can do object similarity matching, but not things like **FINISH**)
